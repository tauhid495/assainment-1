                advertisement and the motivational video of Jhankar Mahmub. That videos were awsome. By that addvertise

            <h2 class="h2-modify">Know our Active Community</h2>
            <p>A developer community generally defined is a group of developers gathered in a place to achieve a common
                goal. ... This transitions your organization from having a support team answering technical questions or
                having a senior developer answering questions to a self-sufficient community that answers each other's
                questions. <br>
                Humans are social creature. Every level has their community. We web developers
                have also a strong and active community. We are very familiar to each other.
                We care all. We learn together with comfortable environment. Our mentor Jhankar
                Mahbub is a great man. He teaches us great technique. He also motivates us. It
                helps us to achive our own goal. He also motivates all juveniles. Our mentor
                sometimes give nice tricks to encourage learning. We learn web developing with
                great fun. I am happy of being a member of this great community.
